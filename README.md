# Supabase and Next.js Recipe Demo App

This example will set you up for a very simple crud app for recipe management.

This demonstrates how to use:

- User signups using Supabase [Auth](https://supabase.io/auth).
- User images using Supabase [Storage](https://supabase.io/storage).
- Public profiles restricted with [Policies](https://supabase.io/docs/guides/auth#policies).
- Frontend using [Next.js](<[nextjs.org/](https://nextjs.org/)>).

## Technologies used

- Frontend:
  - [Next.js](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - a React framework for production.
  - [Supabase.js](https://supabase.io/docs/library/getting-started) for user management and realtime data syncing.
- Backend:
  - [app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io/): hosted Postgres database with restful API for usage with Supabase.js.

## Build from scratch

### 1. Create new project

Sign up to Supabase - [https://app.supabase.io](https://app.supabase.io) and create a new project. Wait for your database to start.

### 3. Get the URL and Key

Go to the Project Settings (the cog icon), open the API tab, and find your API URL and `anon` key, you'll need these in the next step.

The `anon` key is your client-side API key. It allows "anonymous access" to your database, until the user has logged in. Once they have logged in, the keys will switch to the user's own login token. This enables row level security for your data. Read more about this [below](#postgres-row-level-security).

**_NOTE_**: The `service_role` key has full access to your data, bypassing any security policies. These keys have to be kept secret and are meant to be used in server environments and never on a client or browser.

### 4. Env vars

Create a file in this folder `.env.local`

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

Populate this file with your URL and Key.

Create a table using SQL editor

```
CREATE TABLE recipes (
  id bigint GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  created_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  updated_at timestamp with time zone DEFAULT timezone('utc'::text, now()) NOT NULL,
  title text,
  ingredients text,
  instructions text,
  region text
);
```

### 5. Run the application
Initialize the app: `npm init`
Run the application: `npm run dev`. Open your browser to `https://localhost:3000/` and you are ready to go ðŸš€.

## Supabase details

### Postgres Row level security

This project uses very high-level Authorization using Postgres' Role Level Security.
When you start a Postgres database on Supabase, we populate it with an `auth` schema, and some helper functions.
When a user logs in, they are issued a JWT with the role `authenticated` and thier UUID.
We can use these details to provide fine-grained control over what each user can and cannot do.
